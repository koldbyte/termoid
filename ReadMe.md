# Installation

## KDE Store
[Store link](https://store.kde.org/p/1169451/)

## Build it Yourself
* [Download the source](https://github.com/koldbyte/termoid/archive/master.zip)
* Unzip and cd into directory
* `./build`
* `./install`      (for first time)
* `./reinstall`    (for updating the plasmoid)

Add the Termoid widget from "Add widgets" on your desktop

* The `build`/`run` commands require `kreadconfig5`.
* Do *not* run the `install`/`reinstall` scripts with `sudo` or the plasmoid will be placed in `/usr/share/` instead of your home directory.

## Locations

* `/usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/`  
  Where KDE's default plasmoids are stored.
* `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/`  
  Where downloaded plasmoids are stored. It's also where this plasmoid will be installed to.

# Using Nethogs in Termoid
Install package `nethogs`  
Run `sudo setcap "cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+pe" /usr/bin/nethogs` once on the system so that sudo permission is not required for running nethogs.

# TODOs
* Restart plasmoid command without restarting whole plasmashell.
* Support for Keyboard input.
* Support for button form in panel.
* Make sudo commands runnable.
* More configuration.
